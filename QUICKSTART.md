python cli.py analyze BTC --detailed
python cli.py feargreed --detailed

### Before Making a Trade
1. Run detailed analysis on your target coin
2. Check for signal confluence (3+ indicators agreeing)
3. Review Fear & Greed for sentiment
4. Check comparison to see if other coins show similar signals
5. Make decision based on YOUR strategy and risk tolerance

## Tips

1. **Don't rely on a single indicator** - Look for confluence
2. **Context matters** - A "top" signal at $30k is different than at $100k
3. **Use with other analysis** - These are tools, not crystal balls
4. **Set up a routine** - Check daily/weekly consistently
5. **Take notes** - Track what signals preceded major moves

## Troubleshooting

**"Command not found"**
```bash
python3 cli.py analyze BTC  # Try python3 instead
```

**"Module not found"**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Reinstall dependencies
```

**"API Error" or "Rate Limited"**
- Wait 5 minutes and try again
- CoinGecko API has rate limits on free tier
